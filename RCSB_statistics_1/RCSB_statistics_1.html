So... I'm in the lab today thinking about the distribution of amino acids in proteins (yes. very, very nerdy I must say). <br>
<span></span>Actually,
 there was some utility to this as some of my work involves 
site-specific tagging of proteins. In particular, I was curious to know 
the distribution of lysine residues among all proteins as this is one of
 my favourite residues to label/tag. <br>
<br>
<span>Of course we don't 
have sequences for all proteins in existence but we do know the sequence
 for ~100,000 or so proteins (in just the Protein Data Bank alone).</span><br>
<span>www.rcsb.org</span><br>
<br>
<span>I
 will give a tutorial later on use and some nifty things you can do on 
the PDB website. But for now, lets continue with the objective I set out
 to do.</span><span> Find the distribution of lysine residues across all protein sequences published in the PDB. </span><br>
<br>
<span>It
 was a bit of a hack job but I
 basically mashed a bunch of awk one-liners together to achieve the 
desired result (shown below). <br>
<br>

<br>
As you can see, there are ~40,000 or so proteins (~40%) with less than
5 lysine residues. Oddly, there is a bit of a spike at 11 lysines...<br>
I plan to do more PDB statistics in the future.<br>
